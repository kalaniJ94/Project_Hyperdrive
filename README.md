# Project_Hyperdrive

## User Story
1. As a user, I want to use an educational tool to learn more about exoplanets outside of our solar system. 
2  As a user, I want to be able to store and revisit data I have learned about those exoplanets. 
## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a webpage with explorable planet data. 
- WHEN I load up the page for the first time, I am greeted with a login page to sign into an account, or     sign-up.
-THEN I am taken to the homepage
-WHEN I am taken to the homepage, I am greeted with a "cockpit" view, with a transparent background.
-WHEN I login, a receive a "mission" to investigate a planet.
-THEN I can choose to travel to the mission destination.
-WHEN I travel to a destination I am taken to the "hyperspace" page, which features a moving animation and a timer counting down, based on the lightyears to destination.
WHEN I get bored of watching this timer, I can skip ahead to the planet via a "wormhole" feature.
-THEN I "arrive" at the destination I am greeted with a "captain's log" of information about the planet destination.
-THEN I can see my mission counter go up by one, and habitable planet counter go up by one IF certain conditions are met. 
-WHEN I complete a mission, I can receive another mission.
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here
